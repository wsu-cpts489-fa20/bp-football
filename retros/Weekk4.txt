Meeting date: 12/07/2020
As a group our communication and work effort has started a lot earler compared to in the past. Work was getting done sooner and everyone was making updates in the team chat. One
thing we could work on as a group was the commit activity. We tend to get lost in the code and forget to commit as much as we should, which would not only benefit our workflow
but also it would help others break down the changes faster.
