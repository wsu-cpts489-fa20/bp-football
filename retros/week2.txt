Meeting date: 11/16/2020
We talked about our first week's progress as a team. What we decided went well was the live coding portion of our meetings.
One person acts as a driver while the rest of the team watches and makes any comments on what should be implemented and 
what isn't necessary for the requirements. 

We felt we didn't meet enough last week, so we should amp our meet times to at least 3 times a week. There were also some
things we forgot to do for the milestone, and we ended up losing points over that.

In order to improve, we feel it is necessary to review the milestone every week to make sure we have done the development
process properly. There have been a couple steps we overlooked that might smooth the collaboration aspect as a whole.
